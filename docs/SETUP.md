# Installing on Chrome

* Go to the [releases](https://github.com/hackermondev/Discord-Level-Helper/releases) and download the ``extension.crx`` file on your computer. Save it some where useful because you'll need it again. 

* Open a new tab on your Google Chrome browser and type in ``chrome://extensions``. This is how you will upload the extension

* Drag the ``extension.crx`` file that you downloaded earlier onto the page and a popup should appear, accept the permissions and install the extension.


# Setting up the extension

* Go to https://discord.com and make sure you are logged in to Discord on the chrome browser.
* Yuo will also need to be logged in the official https://mee6.xyz website. Go to that website and ``Login with Discord```
